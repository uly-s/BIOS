# BIOS
This repo to serve as groundwork documentation for what I've named BIOS in the spirit of unnecessarily slick and terse names for things in tech.

## The idea: a primer, prep-school, or enrichment program for future bootcamp students or CS majors

That firmly is not intended to follow the typical model of a freshman/sophomore level introductory programming course.

## Course content: basis

The content would be based on what I found worked by far the best working for several years as an online tutor being assigned to random students with wildly varying needs in many contexts. (I will go more into the numbers and reasoning behind this elsewhere, wanting to keep this page compact). 

In short I found directly teaching the material or topic specific to what assignment they needed help with to be pretty useless at getting them to be a self sufficient. They're problem wasn't that they didn't know how hash tables or polymorphism worked it was that nobody ever taught them the skills or mindset needed to be a self improving programmer and work through problems on their own. 

So instead I learned to hammer on the same basic set of principles over and over until it became second nature. All things you evantually learn from experience or mentors but I found to be rarely taught directly. The difference between teaching those principles and the traditional lecture or tutoring approach was night and day. (I will detail these principles elsewhere and am very open to suggestions and feedback)>

## Course format and specifics

In general I plan for this to be loosely structured and informal compared to something like a paid bootcamp while developing and refining the optimal structure and lesson plan (don't get worried just yet!). To be specific I'd like to start with something like:

- A 2 month program with around 10 students
- 1 long workshop style lecture once a week lasting perhaps 4 to 6 hours
- at least 1 hour of 1 on 1 time per student per week
- a discord or slack style channel where students can ask either me or each other questions
- weekly goals tied to assignments and tasks, made to teach aformentioned principles as well as important programming and computer science concepts. We can call these modules.
- variety of resources and materials to provide raw practice in tune with each module

### Technologies to be used and taught (justification and explanation within)

1. Javascript and Node.js for basics well taught with console apps. 
2. Vanilla HTML and CSS to the extent they can make a personal site or landing page without huge amounts of dependencies or templating languages
3. (Controversial) C run a unix system to give an idea of what higher level languages and constructs are doing under the hood (and why we use them instead of C).
4. Introduce typescript and teach to the level they can appreciate it over JS/C
5. Use tools of 1-3 to demystify and teach important software and computing concepts such as servers, databases, web protocols, processes etc. The goal here is
